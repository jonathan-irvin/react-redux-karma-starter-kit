# React Redux Starter Kit

##Motivation
  - I love React, but I hate setting it up. I seriously wasted my entire Friday night and all day 
 Saturday trying to setup istanbul.
 
## Solution
- I love doing personal projects, and I hate having to setup a new project every single time

## What this provides
- This provides you with a React application that already has webpack, karma, babel, code coverage reports, 
redux, and react-router setup without you having to do anything. For some reason I couldn't find this
anywhere.


##How to use me

`npm install react-redux-starter-kit && ./shell-script.sh`
